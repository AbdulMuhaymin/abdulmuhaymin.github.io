Hello!

I am **Abdul Muhaymin**, a senior year undergraduate at the department of Physics, Bilkent University. I am primarily interested in computational material science. Other than material science, my interest covers a wide range of topics such as data analysis (trendy stuff), computational astronomy and astrophysics (cool stuff) and nonlinear physics (nerdy stuff). I also have a keen interest in philosophy, especially in formal epistemology, logic and philosophy of science.
