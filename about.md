Hello!

I am **Abdul Muhaymin**, a Material Science & Nanotechnology graduate student at Bilkent University. I obtained a BS degree in Physics from the department of Physics, Bilkent University. I am primarily interested in computational material science. My current focus is on the *ab-initio* investigation of transition metal defect centers in wide band gap semiconductors. Other than material science, my interest covers a wide range of topics such as data analysis (trendy stuff), computational astronomy and astrophysics (cool stuff) and nonlinear physics (nerdy stuff). I also have a keen interest in philosophy, especially in formal epistemology, logic and philosophy of science.
