title: Role of Nonlinearlity in the Origin of Life
published: true

Did you know that non-linearity played a significant role in the emergence of life? At least FC Frank's model of biological homochirality says so! In this article I will try explain this model like I am explaining it to a high school child.


# Testing out latex

$$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$

Probably some of you are already asking what is homochirality, what is non-linearity etc. So let me start from the very basic idea from biology and chemistry and then I will explain the main model. So, today's game plan is to:
     - I
     - I
     - I
     - I
     - I
If I cannot finish
