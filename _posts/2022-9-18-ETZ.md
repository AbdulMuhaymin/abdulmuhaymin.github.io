title: Earth's Transit Zone Exoplanet 
---

*This study is still ongoing and rapid changes in the development should be expected. It is originally started after my internship at Ankara University Kreiken Observatory. For the purpose of publishing it here, I slightly modified it in terms of format as well as content.*

## Proposed title of the project:

A catalog of Earth’s solar transit zone exoplanets and their habitability characterization using a novel surface gravity-mass pattern

## Short non-technical description:

When a planet outside our solar system go in front of its parent star (also known as host star), it blocks the light of that star. This event is called a transit event. We can see a drop in the starlight from Earth if the Earth, the exoplanet and the star are on a same line during the transit, i.e., a right angle view line. By observing the amount of drop, we can detect exoplanets. In fact the majority of the exoplanets till date are detected this way. But transit events are not symmetric. If we see a transiting exoplanet doesn't imply that the Earth can be seen as a transiting planet from that transiting exoplanet. Now if we reverse the parspective, we get a very interesting question. Assuming there are extra terrestrials living in exoplanets and they are actively looking for us, we want to find from which exoplanets the Earth can be seen as transiting planet? This specific region in the sky is called Earth's Transiting Zone (ETZ). This question has been studied by several author in the literature for last 5 years and they have made significant contributions in preparing a catalogue of stars which were, are and will be in ETZ. I extend this question to seek exoplanets that are within ETZ. I then narrow down the question to look for only those exoplanets that are habitable and similar to Earth. I propose a metric to determine how much terrestrial an exoplanet is based on the available data. I conclude that WASP-47 e is the best candidate for such exoplanet. 

## Materials you will find here:

**Code Files:** since most of my code is scattered in different files (for data collection, cleaning and visualization), I have to organize them and will uplaod here as a jupyter notebook file. 

**Data Files:** 

I submitted the study with the initial result to the 2nd International Poster Competition, 2022 organized by Univ. For the purpose of making a 3-minute video, I made a presentation and a poster which I will upload below after the competition ends (hopefully around the middle of the October, 2022).

**A Presentation:** [Not available yet](#) *(Check after June 30, 2022)*

**A Poster:** [Click Here to View the Poster (PDF)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17_yo5_QgbUsx6O7w-SKdgVJbZiuHUcJY/view?usp=sharing) 

**Bibliography:** Here, I list all the scientific articles I came across during the literature review period. For the relevance of a particular entry, you might want to check the preprint. Note that this list is expected to be expanded until the study ends. This list is not sorted alphabetically but sorted by relevance.
