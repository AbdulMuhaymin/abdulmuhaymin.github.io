title: A catalog of Earthâ€™s solar transit zone exoplanets and their habitability characterization using a novel surface gravity-mass pattern
---

*This study is still ongoing and rapid changes in the development should be expected. It is originally started after my internship at Ankara University Kreiken Observatory. For the purpose of publishing it here, I slightly modified it in terms of format as well as content.*

## Materials you will find here:

**A Preprint *(still in progress)*: ** [click here](https://abdulmuhaymin.github.io/ETZ) to access the preprint in overleaf. I used the template provided by the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS). 

**Code Files:** since most of my code is scattered in different files (for data collection, cleaning and visualization), I have to organize them and will uplaod here as a jupyter notebook file. 

**Data Files:** 

I submitted the study with the initial result to the 2nd International Poster Competition, 2022 organized by Univ. For the purpose of making a 3-minute video, I made a presentation and a poster which I will upload below after the competition ends (hopefully around the middle of the October, 2022).
