This is not about physics or philosophy! I am simply gonna write how I started learning web development but then dropped it after learning the basic. However, I am now running a Jekyll website that I'd consider impossible a few months ago thanks to the various online tutorial.

Back in 2014, when I was in my 10th grade, I got a collection of DVDs from my uncle. One of those DVDs includes more than 100 templates of static website based only on HTML and CSS, no JS. Right now I cannot remember how I learned to open the HTML files in a text editor and edit them, but I did and I was very proud of me! And soon I learned how to save any website and inspect their source code. Before completing the middle school, I mastered HTML and CSS.

When I move to the capital in 2015, my uncle contacted several schools in my area in case they wanted to make any website for them and they said yes! It turns out that the government mandated a rule for every institutions to have a website. We were very happy! We bought some domain names, hostings and I spent several months to make customized webpage for those schools and try them by uploading those templates on the cpanel. However, one day one of my uncle's friend introduced wordpress to me and I was simply dumbfounded! What I did in last several months could actually be done in less than five minutes! And on top of that wordpress is dynamic, its themes are so classy, I just loved it. That time I didn't understand what I was loosing by focusing on learning a CMS instead of learning PHP or JS.

Then I was a heavy user of wordpress for about 4-5 years, made around 5-6 proper websites and even used to have several wordpress.com blogs. But hosting wordpress is not free if you want your own domain name! That was something I didn't like. I tried to look for alternatives. I tried firebase, hugo, fast.io and several others I cant remember the name, but none of them comes with the level of customizability I wanted (and all that I find customizable to the code level were hard to learn). In this aspect, Github pages is awesome!

I am using it for a year now. Recently I added a custom domain name to it. I was using this custom domain name with a firebase hosting, but I moved to Github pages now. And it is so easy to manage and control the contents here, I don't think I will ever switch from here unless I plan to experience new things (like opening an online shop maybe - who knows!). The only thing that I didn't like is the look of my webpage. To be honest, I was never good at designing things. Here comes Jekyll. Now my site looks great, powered by markdown (Jekyll-now theme). It is as simple as it can be. I don't have to buy any hosting plan. I simply write in a text editor and create .md files and boom(!), I can see that file as a beautiful page in my website (of course I need to push-commit but that's just a line in command prompt).

I am happy that I passed the most hectic part - setting up jekyll locally and running it successfully. I will not delete any of my posts from now on. I will keep them as a journal. I will try to focus on philosophical writings and popular physics writings. I still don't know if I can configure latex on jekyll. If I can, I will also post semi-technical physics writings. But even if I cannot, I can always write on overleaf and share the pdf. Happy writing  :heart:
