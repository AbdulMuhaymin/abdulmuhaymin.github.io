title: Updating the webpage and restarting blogging 
---

This webpage is going over a major change. Also after a long break, I am planning to restart the blogging. I will follow the jekyll-based <a href="https://tom.preston-werner.com/"> Tom Pretson's style</a> of blogging. Since I am already using Jekyll, it would be easier to integrate. In fact, if you can read this post and access it from the 'Portfolio' navigation menu on the top, that means I am already successful at setting up! I will also try to integrate a disqus comment box after each post. 

Previously, I have used separate pages for blogs and projects. Now, the content of these two pages will be merged in a single page that I will call <a href="https://abdulmuhaymin.github.io/blog">'Portfolio'</a>. This might not be the best name for the purpose, but I prefer using a single word for the menu. That's why I chose 'Portfolio' instead of 'Projects and Blog'. This also aligns with the minimalistic theme of the overall site.

Since now wiritng blog posts and publishing or maintaining them become easier, this time hopefully I can write a number of blog posts. I regret not starting it before. I believe maintaining a blog and experience enhancement are analogous to taking notes in the class and grades enhancement. I am taking notes heavily these days in my matter modeling journey. I will also try to share those notes online. Signing off for the day!
