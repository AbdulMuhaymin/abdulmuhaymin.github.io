# Day 5: Excited States & Many-Body Physics

On Day 5, we go beyond ground-state DFT to explore excited states and many-body effects. This includes calculating optical properties and using advanced methods like GW approximation. We’ll wrap up with hands-on quasiparticle simulations — and maybe a quiz!
