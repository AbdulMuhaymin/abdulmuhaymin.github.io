## Workshop 2025: Exploring Atomic Scale Physics with Ab-initio Calculations

This workshop introduces participants to ab-initio (first-principles) methods for studying atomic-scale physics. We'll begin with foundational concepts in electronic structure and Density Functional Theory (DFT), and then apply them using **Quantum ESPRESSO (QE)**. The course continues with advanced beyond-DFT topics like **DFT+U** and an introduction to **Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT)** through Green's function-based methods.

Designed for **beginners**, the workshop also accommodates those with partial familiarity looking to deepen their understanding. Both **lecture** session and **hands-on** sessions are included.

We use **Quantum ESPRESSO** due to its open-source nature, flexibility, and user-friendliness. Installation and setup support for QE and related tools like `WEST`, `VESTA`, `XCrySDen`, and `c2x` will be provided.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This workshop will be conducted primarily in **Bangla**, but all materials (slides, notes) will be in **English or bilingual** for clarity. The schedule is flexible to accommodate participant availability.

## üë§ Who Should Join

- Undergraduate (3rd year or beyond) students interested in materials modeling or first-principles calculations
- MS/graduate students working in computational materials science with limited background in DFT
- Anyone looking to start research in ab-initio electronic structure methods

## üìå Ground Rules

To maintain a personalized and high-engagement environment, participants must agree to the following:

- Be familiar with basic quantum mechanics: Schr√∂dinger equation, particle in a box, hydrogen atom, harmonic oscillator.
- Have a computer with stable internet (Zoom will be used for sessions).
- Attend **all lectures and hands-on sessions**, and submit assignments (even if incomplete).
- Be interactive: No camera requirement, but active participation is expected.
- **No recording** is allowed and no sessions will not be recorded. Lecture notes/materials will be shared.
- Prepare all required files before the workshop (instructions will follow upon registration).
- This is a **paid, non-certificate** workshop ‚Äî only join if you're genuinely interested. **However, a virtual certificate of participation will be awarded to participants who satisfies some criteria (see below)**.
