## ðŸ“§ General Contact
For any queries, feel free to reach out:  
**Email:** [muhaymin.ph@gmail.com](mailto:muhaymin.ph@gmail.com)

## ðŸ’¬ Support for Registered Participants

<s> Once your registration is confirmed, you will be added to a **private Facebook group** dedicated to workshop participants. You can use the group to:

- Ask questions
- Share ideas or issues
- Stay updated with announcements

However, we understand that Facebook isn't ideal for all technical discussions. For more structured help (with code formatting, logs, etc.), you can create a GitHub issue here:  
ðŸ”— [Workshop GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AbdulMuhaymin/Workshop-2025/issues/new) </s>

Since some of the participants have no access to Facebook/Messenger, we'll be using **WhatsApp** as our primary communication channel. Use the [Progress Tracking](progress.md) page to access your Google Doc, which will be used as your personal notebook and you can put all your questions there. You can also access the Google Doc directly via your email.

## ðŸ§  External Q&A: Matter Modeling Stack Exchange

The [Matter Modeling Stack Exchange](https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com/) is a great platform for questions related to:

- Computational chemistry
- Condensed matter physics
- DFT and electronic structure methods

Before posting, check if your question has already been answered. Many common problems already have detailed solutions.

## Book an appointment
I understand that during our lecture sessions, it's completely normal if something isnâ€™t clear or if youâ€™d like me to go over certain topics again. Whether you're having trouble understanding theoretical concepts, working through homework assignments, or handling calculations, I'm here to help.

Feel free to book a one-on-one Zoom session with me for personalized assistance. Just choose a suitable time from the available slots below and let me know in advance via WhatsApp.
