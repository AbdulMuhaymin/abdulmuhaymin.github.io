# Day 4: Doping, Defects & Lower Dimensional Materials

Day 4 explores how imperfections and dimensionality affect material properties. We'll cover the theory behind doping and defects, as well as practical modeling of 1D and 2D materials. The day is hands-on-heavy, so be ready to build and analyze real systems.
